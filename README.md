# Adaptive Mixture Regression Network with Local Counting Map for Crowd Counting

More code and models will be released soon. Stay tuned.

### Introduction
In this work, we introduce a new learning target named local counting map, and
show its feasibility and advantages in local counting regression. Meanwhile, we
propose an adaptive mixture regression framework in a coarse-to-fine manner.
It reports marked improvements in counting accuracy and the stability of the
training phase, and achieves the start-of-the-art performances on several author-
itative datasets. For more details, please refer to our [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05776).

### Getting Started
- Prerequisites
  - Python >= 3.5
  - Pytorch >= 1.0.1
  - other libs in ```requirements.txt```, run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.

- Data Preparation
  - Download ```ShanghaiTech, UCF-QNRF, UCF_CC_50``` datasets from the official websites 
    and unzip them in ```./ProcessedData```.
  - Run ```cd ./datasets/XXX/``` and ```python prepare_XXX_mod64.py``` to resize images and generate training labels.
  - UCF-QNRF: [[home link](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/ucf-qnrf/)],

UCF-CC-50: [[home link](http://crcv.ucf.edu/data/ucf-cc-50/)]

- Pretrained Model
  - Some Counting Networks (such as VGG, CSRNet and so on) adopt the pre-trained models on ImageNet.
    Download ```vgg16-397923af.pth``` from ```torchvision.models```.
  - Place the pre-trained model to ```./models/Pretrain_model/```. 
  - vgg16-397923af.pth : [download link](https://download.pytorch.org/models/vgg16-397923af.pth)
